# Portfolio Website
Built from scratch using Bootstrap 4, with zero custom JavaScript.

## Future changes
The current state is only static and requires me to manually edit the HTML for every change I want to make. I'm planning to move to a CMS in the future to more rapidly allow changes as needed.

As of now, content are only displayed in one page, which makes the amount of content I can put there very limited. At the tipping point, I'll make categories on the landing page and display the content on each separate page (e.g. by categories).
